# Accelerated Evolving Set Processes for Local PageRank Computation

## Overview

This repository contains the implementation and experimental code for our paper "Accelerated Evolving Set Processes for Local PageRank Computation" submitted to NIPS 2025.

## Abstract

This work proposes a novel framework based on nested evolving set processes to accelerate Personalized PageRank (PPR) computation. At each stage of the process, we employ a localized inexact proximal point iteration to solve a simplified linear system. We show that the time complexity of such localized methods is upper bounded by min{Ã•(RÂ²/ÎµÂ²), Ã•(m)} to obtain an Îµ-approximation of the PPR vector, where m denotes the number of edges in the graph and R is a constant defined via nested evolving set processes.

Furthermore, the algorithms induced by our framework require solving only Ã•(1/âˆšÎ±) such linear systems, where Î± is the damping factor. When 1/ÎµÂ² â‰ª m, this implies the existence of an algorithm that computes an Îµ-approximation of the PPR vector with an overall time complexity of Ã•(RÂ²/(âˆšÎ±Â·ÎµÂ²)), independent of the underlying graph size. Our result resolves an open conjecture from existing literature.
